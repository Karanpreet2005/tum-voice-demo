TUM VOICE - AMPLIFYING STUDENT EXPERIENCES
==========================================

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
--------------------
TUM Voice is a student-driven forum platform designed for international students 
at Technical University of Munich (TUM) to share experiences, raise concerns, and 
support each other.


END GOAL
--------
The primary goal of TUM Voice is to create a transparent, democratic platform where 
international students can:

1. SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES - Post about challenges, successes, and general university life
2. VOICE CONCERNS - Raise issues that affect their academic and social experience
3. GET COMMUNITY SUPPORT - Receive advice and solidarity from fellow international students
4. DRIVE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE - Posts that receive 50+ likes are automatically flagged 
   and forwarded to TUM authorities, ensuring popular concerns reach decision-makers

This system creates a DIRECT FEEDBACK LOOP between students and university administration, 
making student voices truly heard.


KEY FEATURES
------------

STUDENT FORUM:
- Post Creation: Students can create posts sharing their experiences, concerns, or feedback
- Anonymous Option: Post anonymously or with your name - your choice

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:
- Like System: Show support for posts that resonate with you
- Comment System: Engage in discussions and share advice
